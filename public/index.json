These units are often drawn for convenience and not because they represent some commonly accepted area in residents' lived experiences. Despite this, researchers often use them as proxies for neighborhoods since they come with readily available demographic data. Researchers who do wish to move past these proxies and produce population estimates for other geographies typically resort to developing their own, often manual, implementations of the areal weighted interpolation workflow. This paper summarizes software developed for the programming language R aims to reduce the barriers to the implementation of areal interpolation in spatial researchers' work. The software provides a reproducible process for validiating and estimating population values, and also offers a number of approaches for estimating those values.","tags":["GIS","spatial statistics","R","open-science","software"],"title":"areal: An R package for areal weighted interpolation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" My lab utilizes a variety of software tools to make our work more organized, open, and reproducible.

Here are some general thoughts on maximizing your changes for success.\nGet Everything Together When I give advice, I assume that students have been taking notes on the readings, lectures, and documentaries. I think this is the single best things you can do to maximize your chances for success on my exams. When it is time to start studying, I recommend synthesizing everything. That is, taking all of your notes on a particular topic (like \u0026ldquo;Culture\u0026rdquo;) and combining them together into a single study guide for each major heading on the syllabus.\nFocus on major headings and keywords from chapters and lectures, as well as the names that show up in readings and during class. The highest probability questions come from topics that appear in both the readings and the lectures, though I\u0026rsquo;ll pull a few questions from the lectures that weren\u0026rsquo;t part of a reading and vice versa. I tend to create exams that provide pretty even coverage of the lectures within each section.\nThings to Focus On My exams combine two question types - multiple choice and short answer.\nStudying for Multiple Choice Questions Multiple choice questions tend to revolve around demonstrating that you know the definition of key terms or can reverse the process and identify a key term if given the definition. I sometimes test names of important sociologists directly - \u0026ldquo;which classical theorist is associated with theories related to organizations and bureaucracy?\u0026rdquo; (A: Weber). Other times I use the name as a hint or a clue regarding the correct answer. Other times I test both of these things by providing a scenario - \u0026ldquo;this particular person has been in the news - their leadership style is best represented by which of these Weberian ideal-types?\u0026rdquo;\nYou want to make sure you know, therefore, the main ideas expressed in each major topic of the course, the people that go along with them, the social theories we discuss, and the substance of really critical pieces of evidence (I might ask, for example, about the essential details from a documentary, case study, or illustrative example we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed in class). Often, questions related to this final point are pretty general and if you read between the lines, you can zero in on the correct answer if you think about the major themes at play even if you can\u0026rsquo;t remember the specific example the question asks about.\nStudying for Short Answer Questions The \u0026ldquo;Big Questions\u0026rdquo; on the lecture notes are good fodder for studying. You\u0026rsquo;ll be given an example of something, like a picture, plot, map, or just a short description of some social phenomenon, and be asked to connect it to what we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about. These tend to focus on a specific week or lecture, but the best answers will pull information in from the class as a whole. The more specifics you can give, in terms of defining terms and fully exploring the idea in the prompt, the stronger your answer will be.\n","date":1543471200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543471200,"objectID":"b3fb99784bd6f1a1aef7a3a74171dbea","permalink":"/resources/exams/","publishdate":"2018-11-29T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/resources/exams/","section":"resources","summary":"I get a lot of questions, particularly from first year students, about the best ways to study for my exams.

Like letters of recommendation, I find that students are often unsure of how best to utilize and prepare for advising meetings. This post is meant to provide guidance specifically to my advisees, but is generally reflective of priorities that the Sociology and Computational Geospatial Science programs have in terms of advising.\nTwo Advisers, One Goal Every student at SLU should have two advisers, an academic adviser in the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), or in their home college, and a faculty mentor. You are strongly encouraged to meet with both your academic adviser and your faculty mentor on a regular basis since they serve slightly different functions.\nThe academic adviser is best positioned to make sure you are on pace to graduate and to help you navigate the core curriculum requirements. As your faculty mentor, I have a general sense of the core curriculum requirements but will send you to your academic advisers for specific questions.\nMy role, in contrast, is to provide you with specific guidance on how to complete your major or minor in Sociology or Computation Geospatial Science. Faculty tend to know the specifics of program requirements and upcoming course offerings before CAS academic advisers do, and are also better positioned to provide advice on next steps after SLU like careers or graduate schools.\nYour Role Advising is not a one-way relationship - like all relationships, both of us have a job to do. Your job is to be actively engaged in your academic career. Please create and maintain a four year plan that includes all of the courses you will need to take each semester to stay on course for graduation. The Sociology and Anthropology Department has created planning grids to help with this process:\n Sociology Major \n Sociology Major with Honors \n Sociology Minor \n Computational Geospatial Science Minor \nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to use these worksheets, but they can be helpful for getting started. Many of my students create a digital version of these grids in Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers. However you create your four year plan, you need one and you need to keep it updated!\nWhen to Come See Me If I am your academic adviser, you should see me at least twice per year. I send out mass emails prior to course registration asking you to signup for an advising slot. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have much to talk about, sign up for a single 15 minute slot. If you have a lot to chat about, sign up for two or even three contiguous 15 minute slots.\nJust because these are my two regular advising periods does not mean I am otherwise unavailable. Feel free to email me to set-up a time to talk. I am always happy to meet with my advisees to check-in or provide guidance in between course registration advising sessions.\nGetting Ready for Our Meeting Before you come in for your advising meeting, update your four year plan. Make sure you have a good sense of what requirements you have completed and what courses you still need to take. If you are coming in for a pre-registration meeting, take a look at Banner and browse through the courses that are available. You can also stop by the Sociology and Anthropology Department to pick up an updated list of courses available for the next semester. Please come to your meeting with some ideas about what courses you\u0026rsquo;d like to take for the upcoming semester.\nIf you are meeting with me during the spring of your junior year, you will need to bring a form from your CAS adviser that lets them know what you still need to complete for your major or minor. If you don\u0026rsquo;t bring it, you will have to come back later and have me sign the form.\nWhat to Expect During Our Meeting When we meet, I\u0026rsquo;ll go through a copy of the appropriate degree checklist and four year plan (see \u0026ldquo;Your Role\u0026rdquo; above) and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re making forward progress towards completing your major or minor. I\u0026rsquo;ll also check in about any plans you might have for summer internships, research experience, jobs, and/or graduate school.\nWhat to Do After We Meet If you need forms or petitions signed, please make sure you follow-up with me. Please also pay attention to registration dates and register for courses as soon as possible to ensure that you get seats in the courses that you need to be in. I am typically unable to help if a course fills up, so please make sure you have all holds removed and are able to register on-time for courses. Once you are registered, stay in touch and let me know if any issues arise. Otherwise, plan to update your four year plan with your registered courses and start planning for the next semester!\n","date":1527699600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543514400,"objectID":"d1456295c481df1df3629244c8a6d7aa","permalink":"/resources/advising_overview/","publishdate":"2018-05-30T12:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/resources/advising_overview/","section":"resources","summary":"Advising is a critical part of the undergraduate experience here at Saint Louis University.

As faculty, we get requests every semester from students to (ideally) sing their praises. So, we expect you to ask! However, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that students are sometimes unsure both who to ask and how to ask.\nWho to Ask Ask professors who know you well and will have a lot to say about you. For me, this means I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to get to know you outside of class. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never spoken up in class, come to office hours, or otherwise had some kind of interaction with me, it is nearly impossible for me to write a convincing, comprehensive letter of recommendation. This means you need to think ahead! Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until you need a letter from me to swing by my office - start building that relationship well ahead of time so that, when it comes time to ask for the favor of a letter (and it will come time!), I am able to enthusiastically say \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;.\nLetters are easiest to write for students who I have had in more than one class. So, if you\u0026rsquo;ve only known me briefly and in a limited way, you should consider asking a faculty member who knows you better. Similarly, if you did not do well in the only class you\u0026rsquo;ve had with me, you are better off asking another faculty member who can speak to your strengths.\nAnother \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; is to think of faculty as being specialists. I can write a letter of recommendation on your behalf for admission to a doctoral program in chemistry, but do you really want me to? My letter will not carry the weight that a letter would from a faculty member in chemistry or an allied discipline.\nThe questions I suggest students ask themselves before approaching faculty are therefore:\n How well does the professor know me? Which of my strengths can they speak to? Can they uniquely speak to something related to this job/internship/graduate school application?  If you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure if I am the best fit or not, swing by my office to ask! I\u0026rsquo;m happy to entertain informal requests and talk with you about the letter writing process ahead of time.\nHow to Ask First and foremost, ask! Nothing is more frustrating with this process than being cold-called by a colleague, an HR staff member, or by a supervisor asking for a recommendation that I am not prepared to give.\nWhen you ask, ask well ahead of time. This is less important if I am only serving as a reference and will not be required to write a letter on your behalf. I need, typically, at least two weeks notice before a submission deadline for a student who I have not written a letter for previously.\nWhen you approach me, make sure you have everything I will need in hand. This means:\n a description of the position you are applying for, a few ideas of things you want me to emphasize in my letter, an updated resume, and instructions on how I should submit your letter.  If you are asking me to provide letters for more than one or two jobs, internships, or schools, please also provide a Google sheet that breaks down each position by deadline so that I can make sure all of the letters get to their destinations on time.\nOnce you have all of your materials together, please come see me in person instead of just emailing me. This will allow me the chance to ask you questions about the position and make sure I have everything that I need to write the best letter possible.\nIf I Say \u0026lsquo;No\u0026rsquo; Please be forewarned that I might say \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; to a request if I do not feel like I can write you a positive or comprehensive letter. This may be because you have not done well in my classes, or because I don\u0026rsquo;t know you well outside of class. This is particularly true for my larger classes like Introduction to Sociology, where I do not get a chance to know many students outside of the classroom. This goes back to my earlier advice - make sure you are asking faculty who know you well and who can speak to your strengths! I also might say \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; if I am not given sufficient lead time, so please heed my advice about asking for a letter early.\nIf I say \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo;, please do not take it personally. I get multiple requests for recommendations and letters each semester, and I need to prioritize students that I am best positioned to write about. If I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like that is you, I\u0026rsquo;ll be more than happy to help you brainstorm about who might be best to ask.\nFollowing Up Once you\u0026rsquo;ve asked, and I\u0026rsquo;ve said \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;, please follow-up as deadlines approach. I do my best to get letters in before deadlines, and will reach out as I submit letters on your behalf to let you know about my progress. However, it is in your best interest to reach out if you have not heard from me and a deadline is approaching. Please don\u0026rsquo;t feel shy about reaching out.\nLikewise, if you get one of the positions I\u0026rsquo;ve written a letter for, let me know!

Begun in 2009 as a pilot study and expanded between 2011 and 2015 as Chris\u0026rsquo;s dissertation research, the project has aimed to understand the constraints on urban EMS work. In particular, Chris\u0026rsquo;s dissertation used a mix of ethnographic, qualitative, quantiative, and spatial techniques to understand how EMS work simultaneously shapes and is shaped by the neighborhoods where it occurs. Providers experience the city during both downtime and on emergency calls, and play an informal role in managing a variety of social phenomena that are not, strictly speaking, medical emergencies. This marginalized work gives rise to negative perceptions of place on the part of providers with potential long-term consequences to residents of those neighborhoods.\nThis work is now being expanded as a book manuscript titled Medicine at the Margins, which seeks to situate the EMS work explored in Chris\u0026rsquo;s dissertation in a wider institutional context. In Medicine at the Margins, EMS work is framed as a marginalized occupation, not clearly situated in either medicine or public saftey. As an institution, then, the EMS system lacks a clear occupational identity. This marginality is furthered by the very character of EMS work, which is understood as \u0026ldquo;shit work\u0026rdquo; in both literal and figuritive senses.

Limited literacy, an important factor in social disadvantage and an additional source of stigma, is virtually absent from the discussion. Employing a mixed-methods, service user–informed design, we explore the meaning and impact of limited literacy in the lives of public mental health service users in the United States. Of 267 participants, 184 (69 percent) read at or below an eighth-grade level. Next, we demonstrate levels of and explore relationships among both literacy and mental illness concealment stigma and stigma consciousness (for mental illness). Finally, informed by our qualitative data, we describe how people encounter and manage this double burden of stigma with respect to: contexts of concealment, dilemmas of disclosure, and reduction and exclusion. Limited literacy and its associated stigma are important and underexamined barriers to mental health, well-being, recovery, and social inclusion for public mental health service users. Future work should include further examination of the multiple and layered stigmas in the lives of people with serious mental illness.","tags":null,"title":"The Double Stigma of Limited Literacy and Mental Illness: Examining Barriers to Recovery and Participation among Public Mental Health Service Users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Prener","Joel Jennings","Cree Foeller"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483250400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483250400,"objectID":"2598a7f0358ea5e5b7b2fc7b0069953d","permalink":"/talk/uaa2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/uaa2018/","section":"talk","summary":"This presentation from the 2017 Urban Affairs Association annual meeting describes the systematic closure of streets in St. Louis, Missouri.

Despite the frequent involvement of EMS with people with mental health and substance abuse problems, the nature and content of this work, as well as how EMS providers think about this work, have not been fully explored. Using data obtained through observations and interviews with providers at an urban American EMS agency, this paper provides an analysis of the ways in which EMS providers interact with people with mental illness and substance abuse problems, as well as providers' experiences with the mental health care system. Results demonstrate that EMS providers share common beliefs and frustrations about 'psych calls' and the types of calls that involve people with behavioral health problems. In addition, providers described their understandings of the ways in which people with mental health and substance use problems 'abuse the system' and the consequences of this abuse. Finally, EMS providers discuss the system-level factors that impact their work and specific barriers and challenges to care. These results suggest that additional work is needed to expand our understanding of the role of EMS providers in the care of people with behavioral health problems and that mental health practitioners and policy makers should include consideration of the important role of EMS and prehospital care in providing community-based supports for people with behavioral health needs.","tags":null,"title":"Emergency medical services and 'psych calls': Examining the work of urban EMS providers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Juris","E Bushell","M Doran","JM Judge","A Lubitow","B Maccormack","CG Prener"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409547600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409547600,"objectID":"48966fbe6b1d9b32b60ac0c60792893e","permalink":"/publication/movement/","publishdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/movement/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the growing academic literature on the World Social Forum process, few scholars have attempted to systematically analyze the social, cultural, and political impact of the forums. This has to do in part with the inherent difficulties of assessing movement consequences, which is particularly complicated for an activity geared toward creating 'open spaces.' This article presents an analytic framework for evaluating the impact of the social forums through an analysis of the 2010 United States Social Forum (USSF) in Detroit from the perspective of a local Boston-based delegation called the Boston Freedom Rides. We then use that framework to consider the impact of the 2010 USSF, bridging the academic literature on movement outcomes with activist perspectives. We make two related claims. First, the social forums, and the USSF in particular, should be viewed and their impact assessed in light of their generativity as 'movement-building machines': infrastructures designed for the production of social capital, networks, solidarities, meanings, frames, identities, knowledges, strategies, skills, and repertoires. Second, with respect to the Freedom Rides, the 2010 USSF contributed to movement building on multiple levels, but more so within rather than across movement sectors. Our goal is less to make a definitive argument about the impact of the 2010 USSF than to provide a helpful way of thinking about movement building as a social movement outcome, which can be applied and refined through further comparative and longitudinal research. We thus favor breadth over depth in outlining a broad framework for future inquiry.","tags":null,"title":"Movement Building and the United States Social Forum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Lincoln","T Arford","CG Prener","S Garverich","K Koenen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1385877600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385877600,"objectID":"6046521d90517a57d8fb771d6a60ab77","permalink":"/publication/literacytrauma/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/literacytrauma/","section":"publication","summary":"The authors recently began a research study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, aimed at increasing the understanding of the ways in which limited literacy affects the lives of people with serious mental illness. In preparing for the study, the authors reviewed many health literacy screens and assessments for their appropriateness in public urban mental health settings. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine and the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, perhaps the most frequently used assessments of health literacy, involve assessments that include lists of words that the test-taker must choose from or read. Each of these instruments includes language that is potentially triggering for trauma survivors, particularly those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The research participants for the current project are consumers of mental health services, and thus, the authors believe it is essential to remove the problematic language, given that the likelihood of a diagnosis of PTSD and/or a history of abuse is higher than average among this population. However, the authors argue that this issue applies to anyone who administers these instruments, because sexual assault and abuse, as well as PTSD diagnoses, are certainly not confined to those who seek mental health services. The authors' aim is not only to call attention to the use of triggering language in existing literacy and health-related assessments and research instruments, but also to advocate that others take similar steps toward embracing more sensitive language by removing or replacing words that may cause unnecessary stress, anxiety, or pain to those who are at increased risk of retraumatization.","tags":null,"title":"The Need for Trauma-Sensitive Language Use in Literacy and Health Literacy Screening Instruments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Vallas","CG Prener"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354341600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354341600,"objectID":"a2bfd9c82ae289dc4987f66148c7404f","permalink":"/publication/precariouswork/","publishdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/precariouswork/","section":"publication","summary":"Publication of Arne Kalleberg’s Good Jobs, Bad Jobs provides a welcome opportunity to re-examine the theoretical and conceptual frameworks that scholars bring to bear on precarious employment. An exemplar of what was once called the “new structuralism,” Kalleberg’s book provides a rigorous, multidimensional analysis of the changes impinging on job stability and security. Although it identifies a vitally important trend toward a growing polarization in the distribution of job rewards, it does so in ways that illustrate the limits of the genre of research to which it belongs. Constrained to view the subjective experience of work as merely dependent variables, the book cannot explore how social, political, and cultural processes have both shaped and legitimated the rise of precarious employment. Drawing on recent studies of the popular business press and other media representations, we document the rise of a culture of enterprise that has idealized the uncertainties that have come to grip the labor market, defining the latter as a site on which individual agency can freely unfold. Only by addressing the interplay between job structures and such discursive and political developments can we hope to understand the rise of labor market precarity, let alone expand workers’ rights to protection against market uncertainty.","tags":null,"title":"Dualism, Job Polarization, and the Social Construction of Precarious Work","type":"publication"}]
