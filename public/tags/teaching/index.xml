      <description>Currently Offered Fall 2018, Next Offered Spring 2019
I teach a section of Introduction to Sociology that uses health-related examples to introduce the major areas of interest in sociology. For each major topic, like social structure, race, or social class, major sociological principles are illustrated with examples drawn from the sociology of health and illness as well as allied fields like social epidemiology and public health.
The course targets pre-medicine students who are preparing for the new MCAT exam, which includes a substantive section focused on both psychology and sociology.</description>

      <description>Currently On Hiatus
In the past, I have taught an upper-level undergraduate seminar focused on the modern American city. Using a unique television series about Baltimore, Maryland (The Wire, which aired from 2002 until 2008), this course investigates the structural causes of urban social problems, trace their development, and explore their consequences. We discuss the interrelations between different social issues, the similarities between the experiences of Baltimore and St. Louis, and the prospects for urban social change.</description>

      <title>SOC 4015 &amp; 5050 - Quantitative Analysis: Applied Inferential Statistics</title>

      <description>Currently Offered Fall 2018
I teach Quantitative Analysis at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bivariate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced.
Like my GIS course, Quantitative Analysis is built around a number of common data science tools and is designed to give students a solid grounding in modern scientific computing regardless of their background.</description>

      <description>Next Offered Spring 2019
I teach Intro to GIS at both the undergraudate and graduate levels in a combined classroom, meaning that the course has a range of students from freshmen all the way to Ph.D. levels. Like my statistics course, Intro to GIS is built around a number of common data science tools and is designed to give students a solid grounding in modern scientific computing regardless of their background.</description>
