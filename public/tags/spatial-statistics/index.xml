      <description>The Ecometric St. Louis project aims to document the effects of widespread crime, disinevestment, poverty, and segregation in St. Louis. I am specifically interested in measuring the relative &amp;ldquo;health&amp;rdquo; of neighborhoods in St. Louis by using metrics like the number of arson fires, violent crime rates, and vacant buildings. Another metric is the density of street closures in specific neighborhoods, which have been used since the 1970s to limit traffic into and out of particular neighborhoods on the city&amp;rsquo;s north side and across its midsection.</description>

      <description>The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) project is Chris&amp;rsquo;s original graduate research project. Begun in 2009 as a pilot study and expanded between 2011 and 2015 as Chris&amp;rsquo;s dissertation research, the project has aimed to understand the constraints on urban EMS work. In particular, Chris&amp;rsquo;s dissertation used a mix of ethnographic, qualitative, quantiative, and spatial techniques to understand how EMS work simultaneously shapes and is shaped by the neighborhoods where it occurs.</description>
