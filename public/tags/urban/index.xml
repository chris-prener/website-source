      <description>Next Offered Fall 2019
I teach a section of Introduction to Sociology that uses health-related examples to introduce the major areas of interest in sociology. For each major topic, like social structure, race, or social class, major sociological principles are illustrated with examples drawn from the sociology of health and illness as well as allied fields like social epidemiology and public health.
The course targets pre-medicine students who are preparing for the new MCAT exam, which includes a substantive section focused on both psychology and sociology.</description>

      <description>Next Offered Fall 2020
In the past, I have taught an upper-level undergraduate seminar focused on the modern American city. Using a unique television series about Baltimore, Maryland (The Wire, which aired from 2002 until 2008), this course investigates the structural causes of urban social problems, trace their development, and explore their consequences. We discuss the interrelations between different social issues, the similarities between the experiences of Baltimore and St. Louis, and the prospects for urban social change.</description>
