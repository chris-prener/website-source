Chris is an urban and medical sociologist with an interest in mixed methods research designs that incorporate spatial data. He is currently revising his dissertation into a book manuscript entitled [*Medicine at the Margins*](/project/ems/). The book examines the effect of neighborhood context and conditions on emergency medical services work, particularly with patients who have mental illnesses or substance use disorders. With his student research team, Chris is also working on a [large ecometric project](/project/ecometrics/) aimed at understanding disorder and crime in St. Louis's neighborhoods. He also remains part of a Northeastern-based research team examining the effects of [limited literacy on mental illness](/project/literacy/).

Chris's [teaching](#teaching) is split between undergraduate substantive courses in [urban](/courses/urbanwire/) and [medical sociology](/courses/introsoc/), and  courses in [statistics](/courses/quantanalysis/) and [geoscience](/courses/introgis/) for both undergraduate and graduate students. Chris brings a data science perspective to methodology training, emphasizing analysis development, programming, and reproducibility. This perspective is also evident in Chris's [openGIS](/project/opengis/) project as well as his involvement as a founding co-organizer of the [SLU Data Science Seminar](https://slu-dss.github.io), his leadership with useR! 2020, and as a member of the curriculum development teams for [Data Carpentry's](http://datacarpentry.org) social science and geospatial lessons. His interest in open source software and reproducibility has also yielded interdisciplinary software development efforts, like the [areal](https://slu-opengis.github.io/areal/) and [driftR](/project/driftr/) projects.
