**Currently On Hiatus**

In the past, I have taught an upper-level undergraduate seminar focused on the modern American city. Using a unique television series about Baltimore, Maryland (*The Wire*, which aired from 2002 until 2008), this course investigates the structural causes of urban social problems, trace their development, and explore their consequences. We discuss the interrelations between different social issues, the similarities between the experiences of Baltimore and St. Louis, and the prospects for urban social change. We focus on the first three seasons of The Wire and what they reveal about aspects of racial and class inequality that have been the concern of urban sociologists for decades. The course also has an **honors section** each semester.
