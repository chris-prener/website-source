## Can I join your research team?

I am always looking for motivated students who want to gain some research experience. As of Fall 2018, I do not have any additional paid positions on my research team - all involvement is on a voluntary or for credit basis. I keep an active list of the students who are working with me <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io#lab" target="_blank">on my website</a>.

## What type of commitment does it take?

Typically my students who are volunteering their time put in a couple of hours per week at most. If you are looking for a for credit opportunity, I can arrange for a variety of configurations. A typical three credit hour research practicum requires a regular meeting each week as well as approximately six hours per week of work. I find that the students who get the most out of our collaborations are in it for the long hall - partnerships that last an academic year or longer. However, if you are looking to make a semester length commitment I am happy to talk to you about ways to make a short term contribution to my research team.

## What projects are you working on?
You can see a full list of the projects that I am working on <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/#projects" target="_blank">on my website</a>. At the present time, I have students working on two of these projects:

* <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/project/ecometrics/" target="_blank">Ecometric St. Louis</a> - all three of the major strands of the project (arson, <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers/" target="_blank">barriers</a>, and <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/vacancy/" target="_blank">urban prairies</a>) have student collaborators. There is room for additional students to participate on both technical tasks (if you know a bit of `R` or GIS) or on non-technical tasks.
* <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/project/opengis/" target="_blank">openGIS</a> - both major strands of the project (data and software development) have student collaborators. There is room for additional students to participate, but it requires having some exposure to `R` and/or GIS.

## Sounds great, how can I get started?
If you are interested in joing my research team, please [email me](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu). If you are a prospective student, feel free to [email me](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu) but you will need to apply for admission to the University as well. Either way, we should meet in person and talk about what experiences you hope to gain and how you can contribute to one of my ongoing projects!
