I get a lot of questions, particularly from first year students, about the best ways to study for my exams. Here are some general thoughts on maximizing your changes for success.

## Get Everything Together
When I give advice, I assume that students have been taking notes on the readings, lectures, and documentaries. I think this is the single best things you can do to maximize your chances for success on my exams. When it is time to start studying, I recommend *synthesizing* everything. That is, taking all of your notes on a particular topic (like "Culture") and combining them together into a single study guide for each major heading on the syllabus. 

Focus on major headings and keywords from chapters and lectures, as well as the names that show up in readings and during class. The highest probability questions come from topics that appear in both the readings and the lectures, though I'll pull a few questions from the lectures that weren't part of a reading and vice versa. I tend to create exams that provide pretty even coverage of the lectures within each section.

## Things to Focus On
My exams combine two question types - multiple choice and short answer. 

### Studying for Multiple Choice Questions
Multiple choice questions tend to revolve around demonstrating that you know the definition of key terms or can reverse the process and identify a key term if given the definition. I sometimes test names of important sociologists directly - "which classical theorist is associated with theories related to organizations and bureaucracy?" (A: Weber). Other times I use the name as a hint or a clue regarding the correct answer. Other times I test both of these things by providing a scenario - "this particular person has been in the news - their leadership style is best represented by which of these Weberian ideal-types?"

You want to make sure you know, therefore, the main ideas expressed in each major topic of the course, the people that go along with them, the social theories we discuss, and the substance of really critical pieces of evidence (I might ask, for example, about the essential details from a documentary, case study, or illustrative example we've discussed in class). Often, questions related to this final point are pretty general and if you read between the lines, you can zero in on the correct answer if you think about the major themes at play even if you can't remember the specific example the question asks about.

### Studying for Short Answer Questions
The "Big Questions" on the lecture notes are good fodder for studying. You'll be given an example of something, like a picture, plot, map, or just a short description of some social phenomenon, and be asked to connect it to what we've been talking about. These tend to focus on a specific week or lecture, but the best answers will pull information in from the class as a whole. The more specifics you can give, in terms of defining terms and fully exploring the idea in the prompt, the stronger your answer will be.
