Internships are a critical way to build skills whether you are headed to graduate school or to a job after you graduate from SLU. Internships are something that I advise *all* of my students to do if they can, though I recognize that unpaid internships and those that require owning a car can pose a barrier for some. Several of my students have been successful at identifying internships on-campus, which can be a great option. 

**Please note that I typically supervise internships only for students who are assigned to me for advising. If you are a Sociology or GIS student who is not my advisee, please speak to your mentor in the Department first.**

## Identifying Internships
There are a myraid of options when it comes to internships, which means finding the right opportunity will take some leg work. Start *well* in advanced of when you want an internship experience. Some resources include:

* SLU's [Career Services Office](http://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/career-services/index.php)
* SLU's [Handshake](https://slu.joinhandshake.com/login) database of jobs and internships
* many State of Missouri agencies have dedicated internship pages
* [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) [Research Experience for Undergraduate Programs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp) - university research summer programs
* USAJOBS [Student and Recent Graduate site](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/students/) - for opportunities at a federal agency

There are also some specific programs for students with technical and/or GIS skills:

* [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org)
* ESRI's [Student Programs](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/careers/student-jobs)
* The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's (NGA) [Student Programs](https://www.nga.mil/CAREERS/STUDENTOPP/Pages/default.aspx)

Finally, there are a few local public health related summer programs as well:

* Casa De Salud, a SLU affiliated primary care clinic, has regular [internship and volunteer opportunities](https://casadesaludstl.org/volunteers/non-licensed-volunteers/)
* Washington University in St. Louis Institute for Public Health's [Summer Program](https://publichealth.wustl.edu/institute-for-public-health-summer-research-program-public-and-global-health/)

## For Credit?
It is possible to take internships for credit as part of your Sociology major as long as you are enrolled in a credit-bearing course *in the same semester* that you complete the internship. You can take a variable number of credit hours (1 or more). Internship policies are set by the College of Arts and Sciences and are available [on their website](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/student-resources/policies-procedures.php). 

You are not, however, required to complete internships for credit. Some of my students opt to do internships for the skills and experience alone, especially if internships are completed during the summer. The choice is yours, and I'm happy to meet with you to discuss your options.

## Internship Expectations
Most of the policies governing internships are set by the [College of Arts and Sciences](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/student-resources/policies-procedures.php). Once you identify a possible internship site, discuss it with me to make sure it is suitable. Typically, I'll ask you to keep a journal during your internship and use it as a basis for a 7-10 page paper that connects your internship work and organiation to what you've been learning in your sociology courses. These requirements are determined on a case-by-case basis, however, and are subject to change.
