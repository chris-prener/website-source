My lab utilizes a variety of software tools to make our work more organized, open, and reproducible. All of the core software we use is either free and open-source or, if it is proprietary, is a tool I can arrange access to.

## Basecamp
All of my projects are managed through [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com). This is one tool that **everyone** in the lab will need access to. Each lab member will be included in the PrenerHQ, where I'll post infrequent annoucements that are general importance to everyone. Everyone will also be on one or more teams, depending on what you are working on. Teams are created around overarching themes (Ecometric St. Louis, Redlining, and Software Development). Everyone will also be included on one or more projects - these are specific to a paper or software package. 

We use the "Campfire" within the HQ, a team, or a project for public chats, and "pings" for direct messages. Meeting notes, discussions, and resources are posted in the "Message Board"", and we use "Docs & Files"" to share non-essential documents. Please keep your assigned items in the "To-dos" section up to date, and check the "Schedule" for upcoming meetings.

## Project Manaagement
#### Zotero
[Zotero](http://zotero.org) is a new addition to the lab for 2019. Beginning in January, lab writing projects will have a corresponding group for sharing citations and sources. We can also use Zotero to create the `.bib` files we need for our writing on Overleaf.
