The `driftR` project originated out of a series of conversations between Chris and an undergraduate student in his [geoscience course](/courses/introgis/), Andrew Shaughnessy, about reproducibility and the use of software to improve research processes. Andrew became specifically interested in improving the reproducibility of lab processes used in Dr. Elizabeth Hasenmueller's [Hydrology and Geochemsitry Lab](https://hasenmuellerlab.weebly.com) at Saint Louis University, and the `driftR` project was born. Andrew, Liz, and Chris use the project to support the continued development of software tools, principally an [`R` package](https://shaughnessyar.github.io/driftR/), that implement a series of equations and techniques for working with water quality monitoring data.
