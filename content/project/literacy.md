The literacy project is led by principle investigator [Alisa K. Lincoln](https://www.northeastern.edu/cssh/people/faculty/alisa-lincoln/), based out of Northeastern Universtion. The original project was a National Institutes of Health funded R01 study aimed at understanding the impact that limited literacy had on individuals who were living with severe and persistent mental illness. Data collection has now been completed both at the original two study sites in the United States as well as at a third site in Australia, and the project team has transitioned to analysis and dissemination activities. Chris supports the project with programming and statistical analysis work.
