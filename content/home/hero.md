My R package areal, which implements a reproducible workflow for areal weighted interpolation, has been updated on CRAN. This is a joint effort with recent SLU graduate Charlie Revord. A paper summarizing our work has also been recently published in  <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01221" target="_blank">*The Journal of Open Source Software*</a>.
