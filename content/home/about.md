# Biography

Chris is an urban and medical sociologist with an interest in mixed methods research designs that incorporate spatial data. He is currently revising his dissertation into a book manuscript entitled [*Medicine at the Margins*](/project/ems/). The book examines the effect of neighborhood context and conditions on emergency medical services work, particularly with patients who have mental illnesses or substance use disorders. With his [research team](#lab), Chris is also working on a [large ecometric project](/project/ecometrics/) aimed at understanding disorder and crime in St. Louis's neighborhoods. He also remains part of a Northeastern-based research team examining the effects of [limited literacy on mental illness](/project/literacy/).

Chris's [teaching](#teaching) is split between undergraduate substantive courses in [urban](/courses/urbanwire/) and [medical sociology](/courses/introsoc/), and  courses in [statistics](/courses/quantanalysis/) and [geoscience](/courses/introgis/) for both undergraduate and graduate students. Chris brings a data science perspective to methodology training, emphasizing analysis development, programming, and reproducibility. This perspective is also evident in Chris's [openGIS](/project/opengis/) project as well as his involvement as a founding co-organizer of the [SLU Data Science Seminar](https://slu-dss.github.io) and as a member of the curriculum development teams for [Data Carpentry's](http://datacarpentry.org) social science and geospatial lessons. His interest in open source software and reproducibility has also yielded interdisciplinary software development efforts, like the [areal](https://slu-opengis.github.io/areal/) and [driftR](/project/driftr/) projects.
